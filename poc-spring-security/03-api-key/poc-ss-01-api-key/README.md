# springboot-apikey-example
![Build](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/springboot-apikey-example/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

An example of authenticating with a Spring Boot application using an API key.

If you are looking for an example using WebFlux, please check out [springboot-webflux-apikey-example](https://github.com/gregwhitaker/springboot-webflux-apikey-example).

## Prerequisites
This example requires that you have a running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. You can start one as a Docker container using the following commands:

    $ docker pull postgres
    $ docker run -p 5432:5432 postgres

## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Ensure you have a running PostgreSQL instance at `localhost:5432`.

2. Run the following command to start the example application:

        ./gradlew bootRun
        
3. Run the following command to send a request to the non-secure endpoint:

        curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nonsecure
        
    If successful, you will receive an `HTTP 200 OK` response.
    
4. Run the following command to send a request to the secure endpoint:

        curl -v http://localhost:8080/api/v1/secure
        
    You will receive an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` response because you have not supplied a valid API key.
    
5. Run the following command to send a request to the secure endpoint with an API key:

        curl -v --header "API_KEY: aec093c2c98144f99a4a365ad1d2f05e" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/secure
        
    If successful, you will now receive an `HTTP 200 OK` response because you have supplied a valid API key.
